# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction

Using four supervised machine learning techniques to build an optimized classification model for chronic kidney disease classification.
1. Support vector machine
2. K-Nearest Neighbour
3. Decision tree
4. Random forest

Visualizing optimization of hyper-parameters and marking optimal value on 3-D plots.
